        India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25]
        is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area
        and the second-most populous country. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the
        south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the
        southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[h] China,
        Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.
        In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
        Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with
        Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

        The national flag of India, colloquially called the tricolour, is a
        horizontal rectangular tricolour flag of India saffron, white and India
        green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its
        centre.[1][2] It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the
        Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official
        flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was
        subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the
        term "tricolour" almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The
        flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress
        designed by Pingali Venkayya.

        As observed on the map, the Himalayas form the highest mountain range in
        the world, and slope southwards into a large fertile plain that covers
        most part of the country. The Himalayas comprises of three parallel
        mountain ranges including the Himadri, Himachal and Shivaliks, that
        extends from the Indus River in the northwest, to the Brahmaputra River
        in the east. All these mountain ranges are interspersed with deep
        canyons, plateaus and valleys. The highest point in India is Mount
        Kanchenjunga which rises to 28,208 ft. (8,598 m). The lowest point is
        the Indian Ocean (0m). Numerous rivers drain the land and the extensive
        floodplains are mainly formed by three river basins – the Indus, the
        Ganges and the Brahmaputra. the Ganges is the heartbeat of India and one
        of the most significant rivers on the planet. In the north western part
        of the country is the Thar Desert region. The land rises slightly into
        two plateaus, bordered in the central and south by lower mountains
        (Western and Eastern Ghats), that gently slope into narrow coastal
        plains.
